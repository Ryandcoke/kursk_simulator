Introduction
------------
**Kursk Simulator: 1943** is a tank gunnery simulator built in Python. Tank armour layouts and weapon penetration are modeled based on historical data collected by the Allied governments after WWII. *Kursk Simulator* models the overmatch mechanics (the interactions between weapons and armour that determine the penetration, or non-penetration of a shell through armour) of tank gunnery, with a simplified and stylized model based on elementary physics.

contains the collected data that was used to model the attributes of the tanks and their guns in game.

Weapon penetration data was collected from the book *World War II Ballistics: Armor and Gunnery*, which is available from [scribd](https://www.scribd.com/doc/219173969/WWII-Ballistics-Armor-and-Gunnery)
and [MediaFire](http://www.mediafire.com/file/30f70hhd55ipvbp/WWII+Ballistics-+Armor+and+Gunnery.pdf).
